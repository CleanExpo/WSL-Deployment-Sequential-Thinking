# 🚀 Running the MCP Deployment Helper

## What the MCP Helper Does

The MCP Helper is an interactive tool that will:
1. Check for misplaced files outside your project
2. Stage and commit all your changes
3. Push to GitHub using your SSH key
4. Optionally deploy to Vercel

## To Start the Helper

```bash
cd ~/WSL-Deployment-Sequential-Thinking
npm run mcp-helper
```
