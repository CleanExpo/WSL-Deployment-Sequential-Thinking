## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
Choose your preferred login method:
- Continue with GitHub (recommended)
- Continue with GitLab
- Continue with Bitbucket
- Continue with Email

### 2. Link Your Project
After logging in, run:
```bash
cd ~/WSL-Deployment-Sequential-Thinking
vercel link
```

Follow the prompts:
- Set up and deploy: Y
- Which scope: Select your account

- Project name: wsl-deployment-sequential-thinking (or your choice)
- Directory: ./ (current directory)

## Alternative: Skip Vercel

If you don't want to use Vercel deployment, the MCP helper can still:
- Stage and commit changes
- Push to GitHub
- Check for misplaced files

Just select "No" when it asks about Vercel deployment.

## Ready to Deploy!

Once logged in, run:
```bash
npm run mcp-helper
```
