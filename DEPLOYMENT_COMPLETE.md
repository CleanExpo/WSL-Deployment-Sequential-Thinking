# Generate SSH key if needed
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Start SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Add public key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy and add to GitHub Settings → SSH keys
```

### 2. Vercel CLI (for deployments)
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Link project
cd ~/WSL-Deployment-Sequential-Thinking
vercel link
```

## 🎯 What This MCP Does

This MCP server provides a complete deployment workflow that:
1. **Validates** file locations to prevent misplaced files
2. **Automates** Git operations (add, commit, push)
3. **Deploys** to Vercel with real-time logs
4. **Guides** users through the process with an interactive UI
5. **Handles** common WSL/SSH/deployment issues

## 📝 Summary

The WSL Deployment Sequential Thinking MCP is now fully set up and ready to use. It provides both:
- A basic MCP server for protocol integration
- A complete deployment pipeline for automated workflows

All components have been built and tested successfully. The system is ready for immediate use with `npm start` for the MCP server or `npm run mcp-helper` for the deployment pipeline.
