# WSL Deployment Sequential Thinking - Demo

## Overview
This updated MCP server includes a complete deployment pipeline that automates:
- Git operations (stage, commit, push)
- Vercel deployments with real-time logs
- File safety checks (detecting misplaced files)
- SSH authentication management

## Key Features

### 1. MCP Helper UI
An interactive CLI tool that guides non-technical users through deployment:
```bash
npm run mcp-helper
```

### 2. Automated Deployment Pipeline
Programmatic deployment with a single function call:
```typescript
import { runMCPDeploy } from './src/mcp-pipeline.js';
runMCPDeploy("feat: add new feature");
```

### 3. File Safety
- Detects files created outside the project root
- Offers to move misplaced files automatically
- Prevents accidental file creation in wrong directories

### 4. Git Integration
- Automatic SSH agent detection
- Stage all changes
- Commit with custom messages
- Push to remote repository

### 5. Vercel Integration
- Direct deployment triggers
- Real-time log streaming
- Production deployments

## Usage Examples

### Basic MCP Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Interactive Deployment
```bash
npm run mcp-helper
# Follow the menu prompts
```

### Programmatic Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy "Your commit message"
```

## Current Status
✅ MCP server running successfully
✅ Build system working
✅ All TypeScript files compiled
⚠️  SSH keys need to be configured for Git operations
⚠️  Vercel CLI needs to be set up for deployments

## Next Steps
1. Set up SSH keys for GitHub
2. Install and configure Vercel CLI
3. Test the full deployment pipeline
